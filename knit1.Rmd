## Potential Subject: Environmental Policy
### I am considering doing a final project that analyzes the success rate of different types of environmental policy. Potentially, I would address correlations between such things as carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems and CO2 emissions to see if they have a noticeable effect. I also have found some data that is interesting to me that is a flow diagram of energy use and may show some pathways towards reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.
